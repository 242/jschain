<h1 align=center>WHITEPAPER OF JSCHAIN</h1>
JavaScript Token is a token that was launched with the purpose of forming a community of JavaScript programmers, with a platform where they can sell the codes in exchange for the token.

<h2 align=center>Actuality for today JAVASCRIPTCHAIN (JSChain) is:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Developing not only JSChain blockchain itself from the start, but the whole new blockchain platform for programmers on JavaScript — including smart-contracts, virtual machine, mining in browser and implementing javascriptchain tokens in advertisments and other virtual values on web applications market that are using JavaScript, which is now the most popular programming language and this gives the largest sales market in history</li>
  <li>Smart-contracts on JavaScript</li>
  <li>SHA 512 cryptography, which means the most powerfull  security, never used in blockchain before</li>
  <li>Mining algorithm — new JSChain miner for browsers includes:
    <ul>
        <li>Easy integration</li>
        <li>Best commission on market</li>
        <li>Automatic payouts</li>
        <li>Flexible tuning of mining power(CPU load)</li>
        <li>Mining on smartphones and tablets(in browser or in native applications on Electron or React Native)</li>
        <li>Turning on/off from control panel</li>
        <li>Escape from blocking</li>
        <li>PoW/PoS/PoT mining</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Monetizing users on web-site or plugin by javascripttoken for getting JSChain coin</li>
    <li>In perspective, developing browsers on the basis of JSChain, because executing JavaScript in JSChain makes it decentralized JavaScript engine</li>
</ul>

JavaScript Token audience
<ul>
    <li>Miners. It doesn't really matter for them which coin or token to mine, what matters is the rate of return</li>
    <li>Investors who need safe tool with high market liquidity and volatility</li>
</ul>

<h2 align=center>Current blockchain problems</h2>

If Bitcoin was completely anonimous, miners were decentralized and weren“t be united in pools, transactions count in seconds was rising in proportion to blockchain load, there would be no problems. The system that would be the most close to this ideal (preferably with guaranteed proof of security and real decentralization of power) has the biggest chance of success.

And JSChain is our proposition for solving those problems!

<h2 align=center>More advantages of JSChain:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Atomic transactions between blockchains like ALTCOIN EXCHANGE</li>
    <li>Access for Bitcoin and Ethereum smart-contracts</li>
    <li>Sharding like it is in Ethereum( Liquidity Network, Casper, Raiden, Zk-SNARK and Zk-STARK, Plasma), scalable autonomic smart-contracts and system of many layers like it is in CARDANO blockchain of third generation</li>
</ul>
